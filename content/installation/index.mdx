# Plugin Installation

Get AsyncAnticheat running on your server in under 2 minutes.

## Requirements

- **Java 21** or newer
- **Paper 1.18+** or **Folia**

## Platform Support

| Platform | Support |
|----------|---------|
| Paper / Spigot | ✅ Full support |
| Folia | ✅ Full support |
| BungeeCord / Velocity | ❌ Install on backend servers ([see Network Setup](./network)) |

## Step 1: Download

**[⬇️ Download Latest Release](https://github.com/oraxen/asyncanticheat/releases/latest/download/async-anticheat.jar)**

Or browse all versions on the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/oraxen/asyncanticheat/releases) page.

## Step 2: Install and Start

1. Drop the JAR file into your server's `/plugins/` folder
2. Start (or restart) your server

That's it! The plugin will automatically generate a default configuration.

## Step 3: Link Your Server

When your server starts, the plugin will display a link in the console:

```
[AsyncAnticheat] Link this server to your dashboard:
[AsyncAnticheat] https://asyncanticheat.com/register-server?token=YOUR_TOKEN
```

Simply:
1. **Click the link** (or copy-paste it into your browser)
2. **Sign in** to your AsyncAnticheat account (or create one using GitHub/Discord/Email)
3. **Done!** Your server is now linked and protected

You can also run `/aac` in-game or from console to display the link again.

## Verifying Installation

Run `/aac` in-game or from console to verify:

- Server linkage status
- Connection to API
- Packet capture is active

## Configuration

The plugin works out of the box, but you can customize it by editing `plugins/AsyncAnticheat/config.yml`:

```yaml
spool:
  dir: "spool"
  max_mb: 256
  flush_interval_ms: 1000
  drop_policy: "drop_oldest"  # drop_oldest | drop_newest

capture:
  enabled_packets: []   # Empty = use default allow-list
  disabled_packets: []
  sample_rate: 1.0      # 1.0 = capture all, 0.5 = 50%

privacy:
  redact_chat: true     # Redact chat message content
```

Changes require a server restart to take effect.

## Folia Support

AsyncAnticheat fully supports [Folia](https://github.com/PaperMC/Folia), Paper's multithreaded server fork. The plugin automatically detects Folia and uses the appropriate schedulers.

No special configuration is required - just install the plugin as normal.

## Troubleshooting

### Server not linked

If you lose the registration link:
1. Run `/aac` in-game or from console
2. The command will display the link again
3. Click the link and sign in

### Plugin not connecting to API

1. Ensure firewall allows outbound connections to `api.asyncanticheat.com`
2. Check server logs for connection errors
3. Verify your server is linked (run `/aac`)

### High spool directory usage

If the spool directory grows large, the API may be unreachable:

1. Check API connectivity in server logs
2. Verify firewall rules allow outbound HTTPS
3. Consider increasing `flush_interval_ms` or reducing `sample_rate` in config

### Packets not being captured

1. Verify Java 21 is being used
2. Check server logs for PacketEvents errors
3. Ensure `capture.enabled_packets` is empty (uses default allow-list) or correctly configured

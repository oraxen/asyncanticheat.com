# Beta Testing Guide

Thank you for participating in the AsyncAnticheat beta! Your feedback is invaluable in helping us improve cheat detection accuracy and reduce false positives.

## What to Expect

### Current Capabilities

During the beta phase, AsyncAnticheat focuses on **detection only**:

- ✅ **Detects cheaters** - Movement hacks, combat modifications, and packet abuse
- ✅ **Records findings** - All detections are logged with full context
- ✅ **Real-time dashboard** - Monitor your server's activity live
- ✅ **Player history** - Track suspicious players across sessions

### Current Limitations

- ❌ **No automatic actions** - The plugin does not kick, ban, or punish players automatically
- ❌ **No in-game alerts** - Staff are not notified in-game (dashboard only)
- ❌ **Detection tuning ongoing** - Some checks may produce false positives

This is intentional! We want to gather data and fine-tune detection before enabling automatic actions.

## Your Role as a Beta Tester

### 1. Monitor the Dashboard

Check the [dashboard](./dashboard) regularly to see:

- **Findings** - Players flagged for suspicious behavior
- **Players** - Session history and activity patterns
- **Modules** - Which detection modules are active

{/* ![Dashboard Overview](/docs/dashboard-overview.webp) */}

### 2. Report False Positives

If a legitimate player is flagged incorrectly, **report it as a false positive**. This helps us tune the detection thresholds.

See [Reporting False Positives](./reporting#false-positives) for instructions.

### 3. Report Missed Detections

If you know a player is cheating but they weren't detected, **report the missed detection**. Include:

- What cheat they were using
- Approximate time of the incident
- Any video evidence if available

See [Reporting Missed Detections](./reporting#missed-detections) for instructions.

### 4. Provide General Feedback

Let us know about:

- Dashboard usability issues
- Confusing check names or descriptions
- Performance concerns
- Feature requests

## Detection Modules

AsyncAnticheat uses a modular detection system. Each module focuses on a specific category of cheats:

| Module | Tier | Focus |
|--------|------|-------|
| **Movement Core** | Core | Blatant flight, speed, nofall |
| **Movement Advanced** | Advanced | Timer, step, noslow bypass |
| **Combat Core** | Core | High CPS, reach, killaura |
| **Combat Advanced** | Advanced | Aim patterns, autoclicker timing |
| **Player Core** | Core | Invalid packets, fast place/break |
| **Player Advanced** | Advanced | Interaction angles, inventory |

**Core modules** catch obvious cheats with minimal false positives.
**Advanced modules** use statistical analysis and may require tuning.

## FAQ

### Will players be banned automatically?

Not during the beta. All detections are logged but no actions are taken. You can manually review and act on findings.

### Can I disable specific modules?

Yes! Go to the [Modules](./dashboard/modules) page and toggle off any modules you don't want.

### How do I know if the plugin is working?

Check the [dashboard overview](./dashboard). The "Plugin Status" indicator shows when your server last sent data. It should update every few seconds while players are online.

### What data is collected?

The plugin captures:
- Player movement packets
- Combat interactions
- Block interactions
- Inventory actions

No chat messages, personal information, or server configuration is collected.

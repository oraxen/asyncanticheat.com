description: AsyncAnticheat - Cloud-powered cheat detection for Minecraft servers
title: Welcome to AsyncAnticheat

# Welcome to AsyncAnticheat

AsyncAnticheat is a multi-platform Minecraft plugin (Paper/Spigot, BungeeCord, Velocity) that captures high-signal packets and streams them to a cloud service for asynchronous analysis.

## What Is AsyncAnticheat?

Unlike traditional anticheats that run detection logic on your game server's main thread, AsyncAnticheat offloads all analysis to external **modules** running in the cloud. This approach provides:

- **Zero server lag** — Packet capture is lightweight; all analysis happens off-server
- **Flexible detection** — Modules can use machine learning, statistical analysis, or traditional rule-based checks
- **Easy updates** — Update detection logic without restarting your Minecraft server
- **Cross-server analysis** — Detect ban evaders and patterns across your entire network

## How Does It Work?

1. **Capture** — The plugin intercepts game packets using [PacketEvents](https://docs.packetevents.com/)
2. **Spool** — Packets are buffered locally and batched into compressed NDJSON files
3. **Upload** — Batches are streamed to the AsyncAnticheat API
4. **Analyze** — The API distributes batches to registered detection modules
5. **Report** — Modules return findings (violations) which are stored and can trigger alerts

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Download the plugin
# 2. Drop into /plugins/ folder
# 3. Configure config.yml with your API endpoint
# 4. Restart server
```

See the [Installation](/installation) guide for detailed instructions.

## Requirements

- **Java 21** or newer
- **Paper/Spigot 1.18+**, **BungeeCord**, or **Velocity**
- An AsyncAnticheat API instance (self-hosted or managed)

## License

This project is **GPL-3.0** licensed (required for PacketEvents compatibility).

title: Welcome to AsyncAnticheat

# Welcome to AsyncAnticheat

AsyncAnticheat is a Minecraft plugin for Paper and Folia that captures high-signal packets and streams them to a cloud service for asynchronous analysis.

## What Is AsyncAnticheat?

Unlike traditional anticheats that run detection logic on your game server's main thread, AsyncAnticheat offloads all analysis to external **modules** running in the cloud. This approach provides:

- **Zero server lag** - Packet capture is lightweight; all analysis happens off-server
- **Flexible detection** - Modules can use machine learning, statistical analysis, or traditional rule-based checks
- **Easy updates** - Update detection logic without restarting your Minecraft server
- **Cross-server analysis** - Detect ban evaders and patterns across your entire network
- **Folia support** - Full compatibility with Paper's multithreaded server fork

## How Does It Work?

1. **Capture** - The plugin intercepts game packets using [PacketEvents](https://docs.packetevents.com/)
2. **Spool** - Packets are buffered locally and batched into compressed NDJSON files
3. **Upload** - Batches are streamed to the AsyncAnticheat API
4. **Analyze** - The API distributes batches to registered detection modules
5. **Report** - Modules return findings (violations) which are stored and can trigger alerts

## Quick Start

Getting started takes less than 2 minutes:

1. **Download** the plugin from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/oraxen/asyncanticheat/releases)
2. **Drop** the JAR into your `/plugins/` folder
3. **Start** your server
4. **Click the link** that appears in console
5. **Sign in** with GitHub, Discord, or Email

That's it! Your server is now protected.

See the [Installation](./installation) guide for detailed instructions.

## Requirements

- **Java 21** or newer
- **Paper 1.18+** or **Folia**
- An AsyncAnticheat API instance (self-hosted or managed)

## Network Setup

For networks using BungeeCord or Velocity, install the plugin on **each backend server** individually. The plugin does not support proxy-only installation - it needs to run on the game servers to access packet data and server-side player state.

See the [Installation](./installation#network-setup-bungeecord--velocity) guide for details.

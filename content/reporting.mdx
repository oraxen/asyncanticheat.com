# Reporting Issues

Your feedback helps improve AsyncAnticheat's detection accuracy. This guide explains how to report false positives and missed detections.

## False Positives

A **false positive** occurs when a legitimate player is incorrectly flagged as cheating.

### Common Causes

- High latency or packet loss
- Unusual but legitimate gameplay (e.g., MLG water bucket)
- Server lag spikes
- Edge cases in movement physics

### How to Report

1. Go to the [Findings](./dashboard/findings) page
2. Find the incorrect detection
3. Click the **flag icon** (🚩) next to the finding
4. Fill out the report form:

{/* ![Report False Positive Dialog](/docs/findings-report-false-positive.webp) */}

**What to include:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **What was the player doing?** | Describe their activity (e.g., "bridging across a gap", "PvP fight") |
| **Why do you think it's a false positive?** | Your reasoning (e.g., "player has 200ms ping", "known trusted player") |
| **Additional context** | Any other relevant information |

### Tips for Good Reports

- Be specific about what the player was doing
- Mention any server conditions (lag, TPS drops)
- Include player latency if known
- Note if this player is a known trusted user

## Missed Detections

A **missed detection** occurs when a cheater is not flagged by the system.

### How to Report

1. Go to the [Players](./dashboard/players) page
2. Find the cheating player
3. Click on their player card
4. Click **"Report undetected cheat"**
5. Fill out the report form:

{/* ![Report Undetected Cheat Dialog](/docs/players-report-cheat.webp) */}

**What to include:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Cheat type** | Select the category (speed, flight, killaura, etc.) |
| **Description** | Describe what you observed |
| **Timeframe** | When did the cheating occur? (select within the session) |
| **Evidence URL** | Link to video evidence if available |
| **Additional context** | Any other relevant information |

### Tips for Good Reports

- **Be specific** - "Flying 50 blocks above ground" is better than "was flying"
- **Include timeframe** - The more precise, the easier to analyze
- **Provide evidence** - Video recordings are extremely helpful
- **Note the cheat client** - If you know what client they were using, mention it

## What Happens Next?

When you submit a report:

1. **Logged** - Your report is stored in our database
2. **Analyzed** - We review the packet data from that session
3. **Tuned** - Detection thresholds are adjusted if needed
4. **Updated** - Improved detection is deployed to modules

You may not see immediate results, but every report helps improve the system for everyone.

## Report Quality Guidelines

### Good Reports ✅

> "Player was speedbridging normally at 1.9 CPS, got flagged for scaffold_sprint. They have 150ms ping and this is a normal bridging technique on our server."

> "Known cheater using Vape client. Was hitting players from 5+ blocks away, snap-aiming to heads. Happened around 14:30 UTC. Video: [link]"

### Poor Reports ❌

> "false positive"

> "this player was hacking"

The more context you provide, the more useful your report becomes!

## Bulk Reporting

If you have many reports to submit (e.g., after reviewing a play session), you can:

1. Submit them one at a time through the dashboard
2. Contact us on Discord for bulk submission tools
3. Export your findings and email them to us

## Privacy Note

Reports are associated with your account and the server. We use this data only to improve detection accuracy. Player UUIDs and gameplay data are handled according to our privacy policy.

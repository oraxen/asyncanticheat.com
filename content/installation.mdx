description: How to install AsyncAnticheat on your Minecraft server
title: Installation
---

# Installation

AsyncAnticheat consists of two components:

1. **Plugin** — Runs on your Minecraft server to capture packets
2. **API** — Cloud service that receives and processes packet data

## Requirements

- **Java 21** or newer
- **Paper/Spigot 1.18+**, **BungeeCord**, or **Velocity**
- An AsyncAnticheat API instance (self-hosted or managed)

## Plugin Installation

### Step 1: Download the Plugin

Download the latest `async-anticheat-<version>.jar` from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/oraxen/asyncanticheat/releases).

### Step 2: Install and Start

1. Drop the JAR file into your server's `/plugins/` folder
2. Start (or restart) your server

That's it! The plugin will automatically generate a default configuration.

### Step 3: Link Your Server

When your server starts, the plugin will display a link in the console:

```
[AsyncAnticheat] Link this server to your dashboard:
[AsyncAnticheat] https://asyncanticheat.com/register-server?token=YOUR_TOKEN
```

Simply:
1. **Click the link** (or copy-paste it into your browser)
2. **Sign in** to your AsyncAnticheat account (or create one using GitHub/Discord/Email)
3. **Done!** Your server is now linked and protected

You can also run `/aac` in-game or from console to display the link again.

### Optional: Advanced Configuration

The plugin works out of the box, but you can customize it by editing `plugins/AsyncAnticheat/config.yml`:

```yaml
spool:
  dir: "spool"
  max_mb: 256
  flush_interval_ms: 1000
  drop_policy: "drop_oldest"  # drop_oldest | drop_newest

capture:
  enabled_packets: []   # Empty = use default allow-list
  disabled_packets: []
  sample_rate: 1.0      # 1.0 = capture all, 0.5 = 50%

privacy:
  redact_chat: true     # Redact chat message content
```

Changes require a server restart to take effect.

## API Installation (Self-Hosted)

If you want to self-host the AsyncAnticheat API:

### Requirements

- **Rust** (latest stable)
- **PostgreSQL** 15+
- **S3-compatible storage** (MinIO, AWS S3, Supabase Storage, etc.)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oraxen/asyncanticheat-api.git
cd asyncanticheat-api
```

2. Copy and configure environment:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database and S3 credentials
```

3. Apply database schema:

```bash
psql -d your_database -f schema.sql
```

4. Run the API:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

The API will start on `http://127.0.0.1:3002` by default.

## Verifying Installation

### Check Plugin Status

Run `/aac` in-game or from console to verify:

- Server linkage status
- Connection to API
- Packet capture is active

If your server isn't linked yet, the command will display the registration link again.

## Proxy Setup

### BungeeCord / Velocity

For proxy setups, you can install the plugin on either:

1. **Proxy only** — Captures packets at the proxy level (recommended for networks)
2. **Backend servers** — Captures packets per-server with more detail

The plugin automatically detects the platform and uses the appropriate PacketEvents adapter.

## Troubleshooting

### Server not linked

If you lose the registration link:
1. Run `/aac` in-game or from console
2. The command will display the link again
3. Click the link and sign in

### Plugin not connecting to API

1. Ensure firewall allows outbound connections to `api.asyncanticheat.com`
2. Check server logs for connection errors
3. Verify your server is linked (run `/aac`)

### High spool directory usage

If the spool directory grows large, the API may be unreachable:

1. Check API connectivity in server logs
2. Verify firewall rules allow outbound HTTPS
3. Consider increasing `flush_interval_ms` or reducing `sample_rate` in config

### Packets not being captured

1. Verify Java 21 is being used
2. Check server logs for PacketEvents errors
3. Ensure `capture.enabled_packets` is empty (uses default allow-list) or correctly configured

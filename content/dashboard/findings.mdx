# Findings Page

The Findings page displays all detections from your server's detection modules.

![Findings List](/docs/findings-list.webp)

## What is a Finding?

A **finding** (also called a violation or detection) occurs when a detection module identifies suspicious behavior. Each finding includes:

- **Player** - Who triggered the detection
- **Check** - Which specific check flagged them
- **Severity** - How confident the system is (violation, warning, info)
- **Timestamp** - When it occurred
- **Count** - How many times this check triggered for this player

## Finding List

Findings are grouped by player and sorted by recency. Each entry shows:

- **Player name** and avatar
- **Check name** (e.g., `movement_timer_slow`)
- **Severity badge** - Color-coded by confidence level
- **Count** - Total triggers for this check

## Severity Levels

| Level | Color | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Violation** | Red | High confidence detection |
| **Warning** | Amber | Moderate confidence, review recommended |
| **Info** | Blue | Informational, low confidence |

## Player History Panel

Click a finding to open the player history panel:

The panel shows:

- **Player info** - Name, UUID, online status
- **All findings** - Every detection for this player
- **Timeline** - Chronological view of detections
- **Sessions** - Play sessions with finding counts

## Reporting False Positives

If a detection is incorrect:

1. Find the finding in the list
2. Click the **flag icon** (🚩)
3. Fill out the false positive report


**What to include:**

- What the player was actually doing
- Why you believe it's a false positive
- Any relevant context (ping, server conditions)

See [Reporting Issues](../reporting#false-positives) for details.

## Understanding Check Names

Check names follow a pattern: `category_tier_checkname`

Examples:
- `movement_core_flight_ascend` - Core movement check for upward flight
- `combat_advanced_aim_headsnap` - Advanced combat check for suspicious aim

See [Detection Checks](../checks) for a full reference.

## Filtering and Search

Use the search box to filter findings by:

- Player name
- Check name
- UUID

## Taking Action

During the beta, AsyncAnticheat does **not** automatically punish players. You must manually review findings and take action through your existing moderation tools.

Future versions will support:

- Automatic kick/ban based on thresholds
- Webhook notifications
- In-game staff alerts

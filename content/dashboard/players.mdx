# Players Page

The Players page shows all players who have connected to your server, with their session history and detection status.

## Player Cards

Each player appears as a card showing:

- **Avatar** — Minecraft head from mc-heads.net
- **Name** — Player's Minecraft username
- **Last seen** — When they were last on the server
- **Findings count** — Number of detections
- **Sessions count** — Number of play sessions
- **Online indicator** — Green dot if currently online

## Filtering Players

Use the filter buttons to focus on specific players:

| Filter | Shows |
|--------|-------|
| **All** | Every player who has connected |
| **Online** | Players currently on the server |
| **Flagged** | Players with at least one finding |

Use the **search box** to find players by name or UUID.

View all sessions for this player:

- **Duration** — How long they played
- **Findings** — Detections during that session

## Reporting Undetected Cheats

If you know a player was cheating but wasn't flagged:

1. Click the player card
2. Click **"Report undetected cheat"**
3. Fill out the form:


**Required information:**

- **Cheat type** — What kind of cheat (speed, flight, aimbot, etc.)
- **Description** — What you observed
- **Timeframe** — When it happened (select within the session)

**Optional but helpful:**

- **Evidence URL** — Link to video recording
- **Additional context** — Any other relevant details

See [Reporting Issues](../reporting) for more details.

## Online Status

A player is considered "online" if they sent data within the last 5 minutes. The green dot indicator shows their real-time status.

## Session Tracking

Each time a player joins and leaves your server, it's recorded as a session. Sessions help you:

- Track play patterns
- Correlate cheating with specific time periods
- Identify ban evaders with similar session patterns
